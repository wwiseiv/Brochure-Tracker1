      "content": "When a merchant says they're happy with their current processor, acknowledge their satisfaction first. Say: 'That's great to hear - a good processor relationship is important. Mind if I ask what you like most about them?' This opens dialogue. Then ask: 'When was the last time you compared rates?' Most merchants haven't checked in 2+ years. Offer a free statement analysis: 'I'd love to show you a side-by-side comparison - no obligation. You might be surprised what you find.'",

      "content": "When merchants say they're locked in a contract, first find out the details: 'I understand. Do you know when your contract ends and what the early termination fee would be?' Often they don't know. Then calculate: 'If you're overpaying $200/month and have 8 months left, that's $1,600 in savings minus any termination fee. Let's see if the math makes sense.' Many contracts have buyout clauses we can help with, or the savings outweigh the penalty.",

To help you think it through, what specific aspects would you like to consider?' This reveals their real concern. Common responses: 'I need to check with my partner' (offer to meet together), 'I want to compare' (offer competitive analysis), 'It's just a lot' (simplify to one key benefit). Always set a specific follow-up: 'How about I call you Thursday at 2pm?'",

      "content": "When a merchant objects to rates, first understand their current situation: 'What rates are you paying now?' Often they don't know their effective rate. Explain: 'There are three components: interchange (set by Visa/MC), processor markup, and fees. I can't change interchange, but I can show you exactly what our markup is versus what you're paying now.' Use a statement analysis to show the real comparison. For PayLo: 'With dual pricing, your effective rate can be near zero because customers cover the fee.'",

Here's the pitch: 'PayLo eliminates your processing costs by showing customers a small convenience fee for card payments. You keep 100% of the cash price. It's legal in all 50 states when done correctly. We handle all compliance - proper signage, receipt formatting, everything. Most customers don't mind - they're used to it at gas stations. Your competitors are probably already doing this. Would you like to see how much you'd save each month?'",

Ask: 'Are you currently PCI compliant? Do you know when your last assessment was?'",

I just need to verify a few details - is the business name exactly as it appears on your bank statement?' If they object, it reveals their true concern. If they answer, they've mentally committed.

Present findings: 'Your effective rate is X%. Based on your volume, you're paying $Y in fees. I can get that to $Z, saving you $$ monthly.' Always show math - transparency builds trust.",
