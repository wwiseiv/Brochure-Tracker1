  - Phase 2: "Want me to explain any of these discovery questions in more detail?"
  - Phase 3: "Would you like help calculating savings for a specific merchant volume?"
  - Quiz: "Stuck on a question? I can provide a hint without giving the answer."

**C. AI-Powered Features to Add:**
```javascript
// AI Help System Functions
const aiHelpSystem = {
  // Script customization
  customizeScript: (industry, area, repName) => {},
  
  // Savings calculator
  calculateSavings: (monthlyVolume, currentRate) => {},
  
  // Objection handler
  getObjectionResponse: (objection) => {},
  
  // Quiz hints
  getQuizHint: (questionIndex) => {},
  
  // Role-play practice
  startRolePlay: (scenario) => {},
  
  // Document explainer
  explainDocument: (docName) => {},
  
  // Process navigator
  getNextStep: (currentPhase, completedActions) => {}
};
```

**D. Pre-built AI Prompts/Quick Actions:**
- "Customize this script for [industry]"
