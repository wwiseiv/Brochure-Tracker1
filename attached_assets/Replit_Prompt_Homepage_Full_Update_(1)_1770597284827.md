# REPLIT TASK: Update PCB Auto Homepage — Complete Feature Showcase

## CRITICAL: Do NOT Break These Existing Elements
The homepage already has these elements that MUST remain exactly where they are:
- The existing **hero section** (headline, tagline, CTA buttons)
- The **demo video section** with the Vimeo embed (https://player.vimeo.com/video/1163099932?h=37a0e865bc&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0&autoplay=0)
- Any existing navigation/header/footer

Do NOT remove, reorder, or break any of these. You are ADDING new feature sections and updating existing feature sections to be comprehensive.

## What This Page Is

This is the **public-facing marketing homepage** at pcbisv.com — NOT the app dashboard. It's what a prospective auto repair shop owner sees when they land on the site. It needs to:
1. Immediately communicate what PCB Auto does
2. Show every feature with visual appeal
3. Convert visitors into demo requests or sign-ups
4. Look professional — this competes with Tekmetric, Shop-Ware, and AutoVitals

---

## Page Structure (Top to Bottom)

The homepage should flow in this order. Keep existing sections in place and add/update the feature sections:

```
1. HERO SECTION (existing — keep as-is)
2. DEMO VIDEO SECTION (existing — keep as-is)
3. FEATURES OVERVIEW (update/add — the main feature grid)
4. FEATURE DEEP DIVES (add — expandable sections for each major feature)
5. INTEGRATIONS BAR (add — logos/icons for PartsTech, QuickBooks, etc.)
6. PRICING / CTA SECTION (add or update)
7. FOOTER (existing — keep as-is)
```

---

## Section 3: FEATURES OVERVIEW

This is the primary feature grid. It should show ALL 12 features of PCB Auto as a clean, scannable grid. Each feature gets an icon, a title, and a one-liner.

## Section 4: FEATURE DEEP DIVES

Below the grid, add expanded sections for the TOP 5 features. These are the selling points that deserve more space. Use alternating layouts (image-left/text-right, then text-left/image-right).

### Deep Dive 1: Dual Pricing
**Layout:** Image/mockup on left, text on right
**Headline:** "Dual Pricing That Keeps You Compliant and Profitable"
**Body:** "Every estimate, invoice, and receipt shows two prices — a cash price and a card price. Your customer chooses how to pay. No hidden fees, no surcharges, no fine print. Legal in all 50 states. The difference goes straight to covering your processing costs, so you keep the same margin either way."
**Key points (as small badges or icons, NOT bullet points):**
- Legal in all 50 states
- Cash price and card price on every document
- Configurable rate (3.00% – 4.00%)
- Customer never sees a fee — just two prices
**Image:** Use Nano Banana Pro to generate an image of a clean payment screen showing two options: "Cash $549.64" and "Card $568.82" on a tablet/iPad mockup. Style: modern, clean, dark UI.

### Deep Dive 2: Digital Inspections
**Layout:** Text on left, image on right
**Headline:** "Inspections That Sell Work — Without the Hard Sell"
**Body:** "Your tech does a 72-point inspection on a tablet, right in the bay. One tap for green, yellow, or red. Photos from the camera go right on the report. When it's done, the customer gets a clean visual report on their phone — they see exactly what needs attention, with pictures. Items they approve convert to service lines on the RO with one click."
**Key points:**
- 72-point checklist across 9 categories
- Photo capture built in
- Green / Yellow / Red one-tap scoring
- Customer report sent via text

See live inventory, wholesale pricing, ratings, and delivery times from O'Reilly, NAPA, AutoZone, Advance, WorldPac, and more. Add parts to your cart, and they land on the RO with your markup already calculated. No double-entry. No mistakes."
**Key points:**
- 30,000+ supplier locations

**Headline:** "An Expert in Your Pocket — On Every Screen"
**Body:** "PCB Auto includes an AI assistant that lives on every page of the application. It knows which screen you're on, which repair order you're looking at, and how your shop is configured. Ask it anything — by typing or by voice. It walks you through the process step by step. New employee? They're productive on day one."
**Key points:**
- Context-aware — knows your current page and RO

## Section 6: CTA / PRICING SECTION

A strong closing section that drives action.

**Headline:** "Stop Paying for Five Systems That Don't Talk to Each Other"
**Subheadline:** "PCB Auto replaces your estimate tool, your inspection app, your parts catalog, your scheduler, and your payment system — with one platform that connects everything."
**CTA Buttons (side by side):**
- Primary: "Schedule a Demo" → large, prominent, brand color
- Secondary: "Watch the Video" → outlined, scrolls up to video section

**Below the buttons (small, trust text):**
"Built for independent auto repair shops · Bundled with payment processing · Fraction of the cost of Tekmetric or Shop-Ware"

---

## Image Generation Instructions

For the feature deep dive images, use **Nano Banana Pro** (or similar AI image generation available in Replit). If AI image generation is not available, use clean CSS/SVG mockups that represent the feature screens.

**Image style guidelines:**
- Modern, clean, slightly dark UI aesthetic (matches the PCB Auto app)
- Show realistic-looking app interfaces, NOT generic stock photos
- 16:9 aspect ratio for consistency
- Rounded corners (12-16px) on all image containers
- Subtle drop shadow to lift images off the background

If Nano Banana Pro is unavailable, create **CSS-only mockup cards** that simulate the feature screens using HTML/CSS. For example:
- Dual Pricing: Two side-by-side price boxes (green for cash, blue for card)
- Inspections: Grid of circles colored green/yellow/red
- Parts: Table-like layout with supplier names and prices
- QuickBooks: Status card with green "Connected" badge
- AI Assistant: Chat bubble mockup with message bubbles

These CSS mockups are better than no images and still convey the feature visually.

## Responsive Requirements

- **Desktop (>1024px):** Feature grid is 3 columns. Deep dives alternate image left/right. Full-width integrations bar.
- **Tablet (768-1024px):** Feature grid is 2 columns. Deep dives stack (image on top, text below).
- **Mobile (<768px):** Feature grid is 1 column. Deep dives stack. CTA buttons stack vertically. Everything has appropriate padding (16-20px sides).

---

## Typography & Color

Stay consistent with the existing PCB Auto brand:
- **Primary dark:** #111827 (dark navy)
- **Text:** White on dark sections, #1f2937 on light sections
- **Muted text:** #6b7280
- **Accent blue:** #3b82f6
- **Accent green:** #22c55e (for dual pricing cash / success states)
- **Accent orange:** #f59e0b (matches the orange in the PCB Auto logo)
- **Font:** Use whatever font the site already uses — do NOT change it

---

## DO NOT

- ❌ Remove or move the demo video section
- ❌ Remove or modify the hero section
- ❌ Break the existing navigation or footer
- ❌ Use the word "surcharge" anywhere on this page
- ❌ Add stock photos of generic people or cars
- ❌ Make this look like a template — it should feel custom-built
- ❌ Use bullet points in customer-facing copy (use badges, icons, or inline text instead)
- ❌ Add pricing numbers (pricing is discussed in sales conversations, not on the homepage)
