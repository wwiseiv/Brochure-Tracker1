You are an expert senior full-stack engineer + QA lead + debugger.

CONTEXT
This app used to work, but after recent updates, many links/workflows are randomly broken. I need you to do a comprehensive “system integrity” pass: verify navigation, verify all key flows end-to-end, identify root causes (not guesses), and implement durable fixes. Do NOT redesign or change product behavior; only fix broken routing, UI wiring, API calls, state handling, and regressions. Prefer minimal changes with maximum stability.

PRIMARY SYMPTOMS (MUST FIX)
1) Navigation is inconsistent/broken:
   - Hamburger menu links: some routes don’t go where expected / dead clicks / wrong paths
   - Bottom menu bar links: same issue
   - Links throughout the app: some now broken due to route/file renames, refactors, or moved pages

2) AI Marketing Image generation:
   - When I create an AI marketing image it navigates to a blank page
   - I can’t tell if generation failed or rendering failed; either way it must display results or show actionable error states

3) AI Prospecting List:
   - Used to work, now does not (determine whether backend call, auth, rate limits, parsing, or UI rendering)

4) Statement Analysis:
   - Used to work, now does not (determine break point and fix)

5) Proposal:
   - Used to work, now does not (determine break point and fix)

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
- Don’t change the app’s intended features or user flows.
- Fix regressions and broken wiring; keep UX consistent.
- Every fix must be verified by actually running the app and reproducing/fixing the issue.
- Add guards so failures don’t appear as blank pages (loading, error states, retry).
- If something fails due to missing env vars / API keys, detect it and show a clear developer-facing message in logs + a user-safe UI message.
- Prefer robust, typed, explicit route definitions over scattered string routes.
- All fixes must include logs and/or tests sufficient to prevent recurrence.

DELIVERABLES
A) A “System Integrity Report” in the repo (e.g., /docs/system-integrity-report.md) containing:
   1. A route/link inventory (hamburger, bottom nav, in-app links) + their target paths
   2. Which ones were broken, why, and exactly how you fixed them
   3. For each broken feature (marketing image, prospect list, statement analysis, proposal):
      - Repro steps
      - Root cause
      - Fix summary
      - Verification steps & screenshots if possible

B) Fixes implemented:
   - Navigation must be consistent and correct everywhere
   - All workflows must complete and show results (or show meaningful errors)
   - No blank pages: implement a universal “ErrorBoundary / Fallback UI” and route-level loading states

C) Regression prevention:
   - Add automated checks:
     1) Route validity test (every nav link points to a real route)
     2) Smoke tests for key workflows (mock APIs if needed)
   - Add runtime route validation in development mode

PROCESS YOU MUST FOLLOW (DO NOT SKIP)
1) Create a new branch: fix/system-integrity-audit
2) Run the app locally and capture baseline behavior:
   - Start dev server and confirm current broken states
   - Open browser console + network tab and collect errors for each symptom
3) Navigation Audit:
   - Locate hamburger menu component and bottom nav component
   - Enumerate every link item and its route/path
   - Validate each route exists in the router config and that imports match
   - Fix broken routes (typos, renamed files, missing exports, wrong base path, nested routes, auth guards)
   - Standardize route constants (e.g., routes.ts) and refactor nav to use them
4) Core Workflows Audit (end-to-end):
   - Marketing Image generation:
     - Trace UI action -> handler -> API call -> response -> state update -> route transition -> rendering component
     - Fix blank page by ensuring:
       * route exists
       * correct params passed
       * component renders result
       * error/loading states included
       * network/API failures surface clearly
   - Prospecting List, Statement Analysis, Proposal:
     - For each:
       * identify entry UI
       * trace to backend endpoint
       * confirm request payload shape and auth headers
       * confirm server returns expected response (or updated schema)
       * fix any schema mismatches, parsing errors, or state bugs
       * ensure UI renders results and doesn’t silently fail
5) Backend/API Verification:
   - Confirm endpoints exist and are reachable
   - Confirm env vars are present and referenced correctly
   - Add defensive validation for missing keys and surface clear errors
6) Error Handling Hardening:
   - Add global error boundary
   - Add route-level suspense/loading
   - Add standardized toast/alert for failures
7) Tests:
   - Add a route/link validation test
   - Add smoke tests for the 4 workflows (use mocked network if needed)
8) Final verification:
   - Re-run the entire manual test plan:
     * click every menu link in hamburger and bottom bar
     * click major in-app links
     * generate marketing image and confirm results render
     * run prospect list, statement analysis, proposal and confirm output renders
   - Confirm no console errors

WHAT I EXPECT YOU TO OUTPUT IN THIS CHAT (AS THE AI INSIDE REPLIT)
- A concise summary of findings
- A checklist of fixes completed
- A list of files changed
- Link to /docs/system-integrity-report.md
- Notes on any remaining risks or missing keys and how to resolve them

GOAL
When you’re done, the app should feel “tight” again:
- every link works
- every core feature works
- failures never look like blank pages
- future updates won’t silently break routing or workflows
