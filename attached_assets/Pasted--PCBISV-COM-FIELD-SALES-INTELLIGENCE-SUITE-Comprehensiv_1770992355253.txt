# PCBISV.COM — FIELD SALES INTELLIGENCE SUITE

## Comprehensive System Audit, Test & Fix Prompt

-----

## ⚠️ SUPREME DIRECTIVE — READ THIS FIRST

**DO NOT REMOVE ANY FEATURES. EVER. UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.**

Your job is to:

- ✅ FIX broken code
- ✅ RESTORE accidentally removed or broken features
- ✅ UPDATE outdated content (tooltips, help menu, AI assistant)
- ✅ CORRECT errors without changing functionality
- ✅ IMPROVE code quality while preserving ALL existing behavior
- ✅ REMOVE all references to PCB Auto (it is now a standalone app — it does NOT belong in this platform)
- ❌ NEVER delete features, even if they seem unused
- ❌ NEVER simplify by removing functionality
- ❌ NEVER “clean up” by deleting code you don’t understand
- ❌ NEVER say “this feature was buggy so I removed it”

If you find code that looks unused or broken: **FIX IT — don’t remove it.**
If you can’t fix it, flag it in your report and move on.

-----

## 🏗️ WHAT THIS APP IS

**PCBISV.com** is the PCBancard Sales Intelligence Suite — a comprehensive field sales intelligence platform for merchant services agents. It is a React/TypeScript + Node.js + PostgreSQL progressive web app hosted on Replit. It serves three user roles: **Admin**, **Manager (RM)**, and **Agent**.

**PCB Auto is NOT part of this app.** PCB Auto is a standalone application for auto repair shops. If you find any PCB Auto routes, components, menu items, database tables, or references inside this codebase, **remove them cleanly** (delete the PCB Auto code, not the FSI Suite code). Do NOT break any FSI Suite features while removing PCB Auto references.

## 🔧 PHASE 1: CODEBASE INVENTORY & MAPPING

**Before you fix anything, map everything.**

### 1.1 Create Complete File Map

```bash
find . -type f \( -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.jsx" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.css" -o -name "*.json" \) | grep -v node_modules | grep -v .git | sort
```

### 1.2 Map All Routes

Find every route definition in the app. List them in a table:

|Route Path|Component    |Feature Section|Working?|
|----------|-------------|---------------|--------|
|/dashboard|Dashboard.tsx|1. Dashboard   |✅/❌     |
|…         |…            |…              |…       |

### 1.3 Map All Navigation Links

Find every sidebar item, navbar link, quick-access card, and in-page link. Cross-reference against the route map. Flag any link that points to a non-existent route.

### 1.4 Map All API Endpoints

List every backend route. Cross-reference with frontend API calls. Flag mismatches.

### 1.5 Identify PCB Auto References

Search the entire codebase for any references to PCB Auto, auto repair, repair orders, vehicle tracking, or the PCB Auto module. List all files containing these references. These will be cleaned out in Phase 3.

**Present the complete inventory before proceeding.**

-----

## 🔍 PHASE 2: SYSTEMATIC CODE REVIEW

Go through EVERY file in the codebase. For each file:

1. **Read the code** — understand what it does
1. **Check imports** — are all imports valid? Do imported files exist?
1. **Check exports** — is everything that should be exported, exported?
1. **Check API calls** — do endpoints exist? Are request/response shapes correct?
1. **Check state management** — are there race conditions, stale closures, missing dependencies?
1. **Check error handling** — are errors caught? Do failed API calls show user feedback?
1. **Check TypeScript** — are there type errors, any casts that hide bugs, missing types?
1. **Check for commented-out code** — is it dead code or accidentally disabled features?
1. **Check conditional logic** — are there conditions that always fail (if false && …)?

**Document every issue found. Do not fix yet — just catalog.**

-----

## 🔄 PHASE 3: RESTORE & CLEAN

### 3.1 Restore Missing/Broken Features

Cross-reference Phase 1 inventory against the Complete Feature Inventory above (all 14 sections). For every feature that is missing or broken:

1. Check git history for accidentally removed code
1. Find the original implementation
1. Restore it or rebuild it
1. Verify it works

### 3.2 Remove PCB Auto References

For every PCB Auto reference found in Phase 1.5:

1. Remove the PCB Auto-specific code (routes, components, database migrations, menu items)
1. Do NOT remove any shared utilities or infrastructure that other FSI features also use
1. Remove PCB Auto from navigation menus, sidebar, dashboard cards, help content
1. Clean up any database tables that are PCB Auto-only (if safe to do so)
1. Verify no FSI features broke during removal

### 3.3 Fix Broken Navigation

Every feature in the inventory must be reachable via:

- Sidebar navigation
- Dashboard quick-access cards (where applicable)
- Help menu links
- AI assistant recommendations

-----

## 💬 PHASE 4: UPDATE ALL TOOLTIPS

Find every tooltip, title attribute, aria-label, and placeholder text in the app.

### Rules:

- Every interactive element MUST have a tooltip
- Tooltips must be specific and helpful (not generic like “Click here”)
- Format: “[Action] — [Benefit/Context]”
- Remove any PCB Auto references from tooltips

### Examples:

- ❌ “Submit” → ✅ “Submit proposal — generates PDF and saves to merchant profile”
- ❌ “Click” → ✅ “Open AI Coach — practice sales conversations with AI merchant personas”
- ❌ “Delete” → ✅ “Delete this drop record — this action cannot be undone”
- ❌ “Run” → ✅ “Run statement analysis — AI scans for savings opportunities”

**Update every tooltip. List all changes.**

-----

## 📖 PHASE 5: UPDATE HELP MENU / HELP CENTER

Review and update ALL help content. The Help Center must include a guide or article for every major feature section (all 14 sections above).

### Required Help Articles:

1. Getting Started / Onboarding Guide
1. Dashboard & Daily Operations
1. Brochure & Marketing Asset Management
1. CRM / Merchant Management
1. Deal Pipeline & Sales Process
1. AI-Powered Prospecting
1. Proposals & Documents (including Statement Analyzer, E-Sign, One-Page Proposals)
1. AI Coach & Training Suite (Role-Play, Objection Gauntlet, Trust Scoring, Presentation Training, Videos)
1. EquipIQ Equipment Recommendations
1. Communication Tools (Email Drafter, Email Digest, Meeting Recorder)
1. Gamification & Leaderboards
1. User & Team Management (Roles, Permissions, Impersonation)
1. Admin & Reporting
1. Troubleshooting & FAQ

### For each article:

- Verify accuracy against current app behavior
- Update any outdated instructions
- Remove any PCB Auto references
- Ensure all in-article links work
- Add missing content for new or undocumented features

-----

## 🤖 PHASE 6: UPDATE AI HELP CHATBOT

Find the AI Help Chatbot (floating assistant) and update its knowledge base.

### The AI assistant must know about:

- All 14 feature sections and how to use each one
- All 36 merchant personas in the AI Coach
- The Trust-Based Scoring System and Deception Toolkit
- How to navigate to every feature
- User roles (Admin, Manager, Agent) and what each can access
- Permission system and how toggles work
- Common errors and how to fix them
- How to use the Statement Analyzer, Proposal Generator, and EquipIQ
- The gamification system (XP, badges, streaks, leaderboards)
- Offline mode and how to sync data

### The AI assistant must NOT reference:

- PCB Auto (auto repair shops, repair orders, vehicle tracking)
- Any features that don’t exist in the FSI Suite
- Outdated instructions or deprecated workflows

### Proactive triggers — the AI should offer help when:

- A user lands on a page for the first time
- A user appears stuck (no action for 30+ seconds on a complex page)
- A user encounters an error
- A user is on the training pages and hasn’t started a session

**Update all AI assistant knowledge, triggers, and responses. List all changes.**

-----

## 🛠️ PHASE 7: FIX CODE ERRORS

Now fix every issue cataloged in Phase 2. Follow these rules:

### The Fix Protocol:

1. **Show the broken code** (file, line number, what’s wrong)
1. **Show your fix** (minimal change to resolve the issue)
1. **Explain why** (one sentence)
1. **Verify** (confirm fix doesn’t break other features)

### Rules:

- Fix with the SMALLEST change possible
- Never remove features to fix bugs
- Never refactor working code while fixing bugs
- If a fix might affect other features, test those features too
- If you can’t fix something safely, flag it and move on

### Common fixes to look for:

- Missing null/undefined checks
- Broken API endpoint URLs
- Missing error boundaries
- Failed database queries with no error handling
- Race conditions in async code
- Missing loading states
- Console errors and warnings
- TypeScript type errors
- Missing environment variable checks
- Broken imports/exports
- Stale closures in useEffect hooks
- Missing dependency arrays in hooks

-----

## 🔥 FOLLOW-UP PROMPTS

### If a specific feature is broken:

```
The [FEATURE NAME] is broken.
DO NOT remove it.
1. Show me the code for this feature
2. Identify why it's not working
3. Fix it while keeping ALL original functionality
4. Test that it works
```

### If you need to restore deleted code:

```
Check git history for any code deleted in the last 90 days.
Look for:
- Deleted files
- Large code removals
- Reverted commits
- Commented out functions
Restore any deleted FSI Suite features. Do NOT restore PCB Auto code.
```

### If PCB Auto removal breaks something:

```
The removal of PCB Auto references broke [FEATURE].
The problem is [DESCRIPTION].
Fix the FSI Suite feature WITHOUT re-adding PCB Auto code.
If the feature shared code with PCB Auto, duplicate the shared code
into the FSI Suite so it stands alone.
```

### If tooltips need a second pass:

```
Review all tooltips again. Check:
- Are there any elements still missing tooltips?
- Are any tooltips still generic ("Click here", "Submit", "Open")?
- Do all tooltips follow the format: "[Action] — [Benefit/Context]"?
- Are there any remaining PCB Auto references in tooltips?
Fix any issues found.
```

### If the AI assistant needs refinement:

```
Test the AI Help Chatbot by asking it these questions:
1. "How do I start a roleplay session?"
2. "What are the 14 stages in the pipeline?"
3. "How does the Trust Scoring system work?"
4. "How do I analyze a merchant statement?"
5. "What is EquipIQ?"
6. "How do I use the Objection Gauntlet?"
7. "How do I export my brochure drops?"
8. "What's the difference between Admin, Manager, and Agent roles?"

If any answer is wrong, incomplete, or references PCB Auto, fix the
AI assistant's knowledge base.
```

-----

## ⛔ REMEMBER

- **FIX and RESTORE. Never DELETE.**
- **The feature list above is the source of truth.** If it’s on the list, it must work.
- **PCB Auto is gone.** Remove it cleanly. Don’t break FSI features in the process.
- **Show your work.** Don’t just say “fixed” — show the before and after.
- **When in doubt, ask.** Don’t guess and break things.

**BEGIN WITH PHASE 1. Show me the complete codebase inventory.**
