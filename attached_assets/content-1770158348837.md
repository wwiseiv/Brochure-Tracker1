IV. After the Sale \- Three step onboarding process for merchants is as follows:

Step 1: Welcome Email & Equipment Deployed

1. Merchant will receive a welcome email from team@pcbancard.com. See an [example of the Welcome Email here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Djkk5rGNsG-kWxMJ1LHztrKdJZ5u-emKc7UuG6K4JX8/edit%23bookmark%3Did.blcsknfstb87&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1770161949460319&usg=AOvVaw0HF3H1U2mkeSPoEIept393).
2. Rep will see an email / helpdesk ticket saying account has been verified. (auto-generated). Kristen or Cori will also send an additional email to the rep letting them know the account has been officially approved. Once Kristen or Cori  sends this email, the rep can assume the welcome email has been sent to the merchant, the account has been officially approved and verified and equipment will be deployed next.
3. Terminal is then shipped via 2-day FedEx and rep receives a helpdesk ticket

1. If purchasing a terminal, merchant is billed 30 days after terminal is deployed (not 30 days after processing)
2. If gateway or HotSauce or different POS, merchant is billed immediately

4. Merchant is enrolled in our email system for further instructions on how to set up their [ipos pays portal](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pcbancard.activehosted.com/f/84&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1770161949461269&usg=AOvVaw1zD2sOs41XE7FhKtWh1XgH).

\*\*Please note that the $64.95 for Dual Pricing or cost for Traditional processing will be extracted from the merchant's account during the first week of each month.

Step 2: Call from IT

1. Rep receives a helpdesk ticket saying the terminal has been delivered and a call from the office to see if the rep wants to be present when IT calls for the first transaction
2. Merchant receives a call from IT  (Erik) when their equipment has arrived to run a test transaction.
3. IT puts a helpdesk ticket in when this has been completed and rep is notified via email/helpdesk ticket.

Step 3: PCI Compliance

1. Within the first 30 Days after approval, the merchant is boarded for PCI compliance. If they sign the PCI form, we do it for them and they will have no non-compliance fees, just an annual $99 PCI fee.
