Act as a senior QA engineer and UX specialist. Thoroughly test this application and identify all errors, bugs, and UI/UX issues. Follow this systematic approach:

## 1. CODE REVIEW & ERROR DETECTION
- Scan all files for syntax errors, undefined variables, and broken imports
- Check for console errors, warnings, and uncaught exceptions
- Identify any API calls that may fail or return unexpected data
- Look for memory leaks, infinite loops, or performance bottlenecks
- Verify all dependencies are properly installed and compatible

## 2. FUNCTIONAL TESTING
- Test every button, link, and interactive element
- Verify all forms submit correctly and validate input properly
- Check that all conditional logic and state management works as expected
- Test edge cases: empty states, error states, loading states
- Confirm data persists correctly (if applicable)

## 3. UI/UX AUDIT
- Check for visual inconsistencies (spacing, alignment, colors, typography)
- Verify responsive design works across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints
- Ensure all text is readable and properly contrasted
- Look for missing hover/focus/active states on interactive elements
- Check that loading indicators and feedback exist where users expect them
- Identify any confusing navigation or unclear user flows

## 4. ACCESSIBILITY CHECK
- Verify proper heading hierarchy and semantic HTML
- Check that all images have alt text
- Ensure keyboard navigation works throughout
- Verify sufficient color contrast ratios

## 5. OUTPUT FORMAT
For each issue found, provide:
- **Location**: File name and line number (or UI location)
- **Severity**: Critical / High / Medium / Low
- **Description**: What's wrong
- **Fix**: The exact code or change needed to resolve it

Start by running the app, then systematically work through each section. Fix critical and high-severity issues first, then address medium and low issues. After making fixes, re-test to confirm the issues are resolved and no new issues were introduced.
