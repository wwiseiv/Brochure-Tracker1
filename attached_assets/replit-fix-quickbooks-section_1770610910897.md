Find the QuickBooks integration section on the PCB Auto homepage (the marketing/landing page, not the app dashboard). It currently has AI-generated placeholder text that doesn't make sense. Replace it with the correct content below.

## WHAT TO LOOK FOR

Search the homepage component for any section mentioning QuickBooks, accounting, bookkeeping, or sync. It likely has nonsensical AI-generated filler text that needs to be replaced. Look in files like:
- Landing page / homepage component
- Marketing page sections
- Any component with "quickbooks", "accounting", "books", or "sync" in the name

## REPLACE WITH THIS EXACT CONTENT

### Headline:
Your Books Stay Current — Automatically

### Body copy:
Connect QuickBooks in 30 seconds. From that point on, every invoice and every payment syncs automatically. Labor goes to your labor income account. Parts to parts revenue. Dual pricing to its own trackable income account. Tax to your liability account. No more end-of-month data entry. No CSV imports. Your accountant will thank you.

### Feature pills/badges (display as small rounded tags beneath the body copy):
- One-click QuickBooks Online connection
- Real-time invoice and payment sync
- Dual pricing tracked separately
- Chart of accounts fully configurable

### Mockup/illustration on the right side:
If there's an image or illustration placeholder next to this section, replace it with a styled UI mockup card showing a QuickBooks sync dashboard. Build it as an actual styled div (not an image) with a dark background card containing:
- A green QuickBooks "QB" logo icon at top left
- Title: "QuickBooks" (styled in the green QB brand color)
- Three stat boxes in a row:
  - "847" with label "Total Synced"
  - "22" with label "This Week"  
  - "$38,420" with label "Revenue"
- A "Sync Log" section below with a simple table showing 3 recent synced transactions:
  - Row 1: Green checkmark, "RO Number", "Acme Corp", "$120.00"
  - Row 2: Green checkmark, "RO Number", "Doe Inc.", "$5,400.00"
  - Row 3: Yellow dot, "RO Number", "Doe Inc.", "$5,400.00"

Style the mockup card with:
- Dark slate/navy background (like #1E293B or similar to match the app's dark theme)
- A vertical green accent bar on the left side
- White text
- Rounded corners
- Subtle shadow to make it look like a floating device/screen

## ALSO CHECK

While you're at it, scan the ENTIRE homepage for any other sections that have AI-generated gibberish or placeholder text that doesn't make sense for an auto repair shop management platform. Common problem areas:
- Feature descriptions that sound generic or nonsensical
- Lorem ipsum or obviously placeholder content
- Repeated or contradictory text
- Sections where the copy doesn't match what the feature actually does

Fix any other gibberish you find with clear, professional copy that accurately describes PCB Auto's features. Keep the tone confident, direct, and benefit-focused — like you're talking to a shop owner who's busy and wants to know what the software does for them, not marketing fluff.

## IMPORTANT
- Do NOT change the layout, styling framework, or component structure unless absolutely necessary
- Only replace the TEXT CONTENT and rebuild the mockup illustration if needed
- Keep the existing responsive behavior intact
- Match the existing design system (fonts, colors, spacing)
